# Randomly simulate 100,000 flips of A (40% chance), B (20% chance), and C (70% chance). What fraction of the time do all three coins come up heads?


# You've already simulated 100,000 flips of coins A and B
A <- rbinom(100000, 1, .4)
B <- rbinom(100000, 1, .2)

# Simulate 100,000 flips of coin C (70% chance of heads)
C <- rbinom(100000, 1, .7)

# Estimate the probability A, B, and C are all heads
mean(A & B & C)
